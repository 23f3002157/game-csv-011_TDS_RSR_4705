The Big Bang theory is the leading explanation about the origin of the universe. It suggests that the universe was once in an extremely hot and dense state which expanded rapidly. This event occurred approximately 13.8 billion years ago, marking the birth of the universe as we understand it today. During the initial moments, fundamental particles and forces began to emerge from an energetic state. As the universe expanded, it cooled, allowing particles to combine into atomic nuclei. This process is known as nucleosynthesis, which produced the lightest elements, primarily hydrogen and helium.

As time continued to unfold, the universe continued to expand and cool, leading to the formation of simple atoms. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe reached a temperature that allowed electrons to combine with protons to form neutral hydrogen atoms, a period known as recombination. During this time, the universe became transparent to radiation, allowing the first light to travel through space, known as the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which we can still detect today.

Over billions of years, cosmic structures began to form. Regions of higher density attracted more mass, leading to the formation of stars and galaxies. Stars formed through the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, igniting nuclear fusion in their cores. This process not only allowed for the light we see in the night sky but also produced heavier elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. When massive stars reached the end of their life cycles, they exploded in supernova events, dispersing elements such as carbon, oxygen, and iron into the universe, enriching the interstellar medium and allowing for the formation of new stars, planets, and eventually, the building blocks of life. Thus, the universe continually transforms and evolves, rooted in the monumental event of the Big Bang.
